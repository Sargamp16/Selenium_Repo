# Selenium_Repo

Introduction : 
Selenium is an open-source web automation testing tool.
This repo will help you understand the basics of selenium coding and is helpful for beginners like me to have hands-on experience with automation testing.

To take your first step in Automation, follow these things:
1. Choose any Language. (Java, Python, JavaScript, etc) and start learning the very basics like data types, initializations, loops, and control statements.
2. Get a hands-on experience with the language chosen. (You can try basic  coding questions on sites like HackerRank, HackerEarth, and Leetcode)
NOTE: Do not jump on tough questions just take a deep break and start again if you are still facing issues while completing the basic coding problems.
There is no harm in starting again!
3. Now, it is time to choose a platform of your choice like Selenium, Cypress, Appium, and many others, and start learning and working with it.

What you will be able to achieve from this repo: 
In this repo, you will find some random Java automation code for features like : 
1. Basic form
2. Drop-down selection, 
3. Get-Data, and
4. Navigation, and
5. Window Handling
